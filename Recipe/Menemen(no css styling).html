<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<div>
    <ol><li>The first step is to make the chunky tomato mixture.
    Chop up 1 green pepper (I used mild bell pepper) and 1 yellow onion.
    Grab a good 10-inch pan (I use cast iron, but you can use any skillet or pan of this size).
    Heat up some good extra-virgin olive oil and saute the onions and peppers,
    seasoned with a good pinch of kosher salt, for a little until softened (about 5 minutes).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add chopped tomatoes (2 vine-ripe tomatoes) and 3 tablespoon of tomato paste.
        Season with a little more kosher salt. Add black pepper.
        Cook over medium heat until the tomatoes soften, for about 7 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the eggs and cook gently. Keep the tomato mixture in the skillet, but push it to one side.
        Lower the heat to medium-low, add 4 beaten eggs and cook gently until the eggs are just set.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fold the tomato mixture into the eggs.
        When the eggs are just set, use a wooden spoon and fold the tomato mixture into the eggs and mix gently
        (don't linger too long here so you won't overcook the eggs).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Finish with olive oil and add more seasoning if desired.
        As soon as the tomato mixture and eggs are incorporated,
        immediately remove the skillet from the heat. Taste and adjust seasoning.
        Add a good drizzle of some excellent extra virgin olive oil and a dash more pepper.
        Also, if you're looking for more heat, add a good pinch of hot red pepper flakes.
        Serve immediately with some good hearty bread (thicker slices of bread are best).</li>
    </ol>
